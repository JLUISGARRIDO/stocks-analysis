# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Project Overview
Provide facilities to Steve (our customer) handling large stock of data in behalf of its research on analyzing stocks. Emphasize the importance of refactoring code and application of the VBA tools in data analysis to improve the efficiency of response. Analyze the impact to refactor a code in saving time and simplify the coding lecture and execution.
### Purpose
Make efficient the stock analysis by refactoring the code. The main purpose is to edit our initial VBA code and measure the performance. Compare both running times (initial VBA vs refactor VBA) to determine the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code. Then establish the pros and cons that apply refactoring our initial VBA code. Finally, according to the feedback of response improvement with refactoring, analyze the stock market in 2017 and 2018 and the results of our data analysis.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the launch date success we can see some trends during the summer. This could be a good approach of when can launch a campaign to have a good success. But also we can notice that the total of campaigns launched per month are higher during the summer. So it is little tricky this analysis becuase we can say that is better the summer because of the number of success. However if we deep inside, we can see that is 50/50 chance to succes or fail no matter the month. Almost each month we can notice almost a 50% of success over failure so we can not be positive to say that the rest of the year (not summer) we can fail more. It is a false negative.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis show us how the goals are related on the amount of money invested on each campaing. The analaysis tell us that the success of the campaigns start to decrease when the goals are higher. It is an expected trend because if the goal is low, the changes of the success increase and when you are expecting higher demands you will increase the possibility of failures. However we can notice than specific campaigns are not following those trends, so for those campaigns we can not be very confidents on the relations.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The difficultes we encountered is how to stablish a correct range of goals classification. We should work better on determine the ranges of amount to have a better analysis approach of the success based on goals. Talking about the launch time, we also notice that it change according to the years. Some years we have more campaigns and more succes than the others. Also we can infer that we have more succes on the summer because of the free time of the people. Which is an important impact of the success of each campaigns.
Also the situations that are involved in each year, as this time whith the pandemics, that could show false negatives.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
__It is better to launch a campaign in summer according to achieve more outcomes.__
It seems to be a trend that almost 50% of the campaigns failed, no matter the month of the year. The summer have more campaigns than the rest of the year which means that we are going to have more successful, however the percentage of the rest of the year is telling us that the trend is almost the same all over the year. So the only strongh conclusion is that in May and June we have a more succesful over failed campaigns than the rest of the year, but also that we have a trend which tell us that we have 50/50 chance of a succesfull or failed campaing no matter the month.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
__The outcomes based on goals have other overwiew. When we start to involve forecast or goals we are putting a limit on the achivements.__ We can notice that the lowest the goal is, we success on the campaign.The highest the goal is, the campaign seems to fail. We can take that conclusion with the left half of the chart wich is more representative. The right half shows less than 5 campaigns per amount of goal, so we don't know exactly what happend on those campaigns.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The main limitations is the campaings that are not representative and may impact on the results and the analysis. We have some campaigns that failed or succes which are not following the trends or has specific impacts.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For a better approach of the project we should add some charts about the relation of the interest of the people depending on the areas or categories of the champaigns. This analysis shoudl give us a better understanding of the successful or fails on the champaigns. But also the ratings of the performances in each subcategory could be helpful on the analytics.
## Conclusion
In conclusion the results obtained on this project give us a better approach to take good decisions on which campaign have more possibilities to succeed according on the month, year and the forecasted goals established. However it is important to keep on mind the impact of the interests of the people and the situation of each country at the moment of the launch of the campaigns.
